# Splitomatic

This project is a work-in-progress application that allows users to log expenses, select participants, and automatically split costs using the [Splitwise API](https://dev.splitwise.com/).

### 🌟 Key Value-Add: Weekly Split Summary

Unlike the official Splitwise app, this project includes a personalized **Weekly Split Summary**, helping users understand their spending at a glance:
- Total spent this week
- Amount paid vs owed
- Most frequent group
- Insight into how much you paid for others

This feature helps users develop better financial awareness and spending habits—especially in high-frequency group settings like roommates or travel groups.
